# Vettvangur project aim
To backport Net5 X509ChainTrustMode.CustomRootTrust feature to Net472
the intent is to allow users to create X509Chain and build with a custom root
Use case: Azure app services

# Vettvangur changes
namespace find replace
using find replace
move linked files to project directory
exclude from project unused code
Work around lesser span support
    .CloneByteArray() -> .Clone() + cast 
        Similar to Net5 CloneByteArray source code
    ToArray since string constructor doesn't yet support spans
refactor C# 8.0 features such as 
    remove all nullable reference code (find replace ? and !)
    inverse switch
    inline static functions

ToLpstrArray
    code inlined from Net5 source and use MemoryMarshal.GetReference in place of GetNonNullRef

## Notes
Can't exclude x509certificate2, need to access internal member pal
proj only includes windows Pal code

Need Net472 for
	SafeNCryptKeyHandle
    Maybe we can go further and grab it's source but this will do for now
